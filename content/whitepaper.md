## Whitepaper Version 0.0.1
**Radically Decentralized Cybernetic Squad of Machines and People**

Never shall this document be assimilated to a product description, a marketing proposal or a financial advice for investment.

We're de-reasonable krk heads, unconditinally sovereign.

## Abstract

[krk.finance](https://krk.finance) is a **radically decentralized cybernetic squad of machines and people** revolving around values & principles such as, but not limited to : **freedom**, **privacy**,**self-sovereignty** and **disruptive technologies**.

End-goal will be to provide **real life exclusive real-estate membership** to our **NFT holders**, location to be defined, see roadmap.

In the meantime, to fund this goal : #BUIDL üõ†Ô∏èüë∑

Income from Projects to be built, will be split evenly between the DAO Vault and DAO Members working on the project being shipped.

The main idea is to use our own products, in a way that rewards our Squad, instead of shadowy unknown devs and VC, then expand ourselves according to Squad will.

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 ze Dev
Before crypto, I was a hopeless hardcore gamer stuck into virtual realities but helped me found my existential nature : "**born to h4ck**" üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüõ†Ô∏è

I'm a believer, and because God watches me closer than the FBI, I'm very unlikely to ever have a viable justification for hurting innocent people and likely get caught if trying; which is why **bug bounties** and **hackathons** offers real opportunity to practice such skills under regulated conditions without risking jail, and rather being praised for fixing issues.

I got my revelation abusing a complete tipbot ecosystem, but faithfully told the devs and got paid $300 to fix that : **breakthrough**

### 1.2 ze DAO
I've personnally took the ride of cryptographic assets in 2020, during lockdowns.

Feeling late, I've felt the urge to scrap as much data as I possibly could, resulting in a discord server full of my notes on different ecosystems, and a Squad of **freedom** and **self-sovereign** minded people üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

The nature of DAO's makes me your obligated, not your dictator !

Indeed : there's nothing holding you from starting a proposal or rally against me, or to start your own project squared with us ! üç±

Such WOW : **the Squad** will decide where common flow of skills and knowledge is going to be used, but I already have some ideas stacked ü•û

## 2. Treasury

Income from **X**, where **X** is a Project built by DAO members, and resulting from a **validated** proposal, will be **split evenly** between **the DAO** (main vault multisig), and between DAO members working on **X**.

Example sources of income : NFT sales, exchange fees, reccuring payment, membership, physical products, DeFi yields, Merch, Royalties, etc..

```
NFT Mint Example :

Initial Sale :

DAO    : 50%
---
Dev 1  : 10%
Dev 2  : 10%
Artist : 10% (or airdrops) // he's missing
CM 1   : 10%
CM 2   : 10%

Secondary Market :

10% royalty
---
DAO : 5%
---
Dev 1  : 1%
Dev 2  : 1%
Artist : 1% (or airdrops) // he's missing
CM 1   : 1%
CM 2   : 1%

```

I believe this approach realistic, simple and fair.

Solana has several tools for automatic payment streams channels setup, including revokable ones (perfect for DAO's), which was part of our choice for settling here.

**Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Terra** or **PirateChain** wallets supporting **multisig** may be created if required for crosschain operations.

## 3. Methodology
To avoid carrying each other's past sins, each **X** new Project shall be created under **X** brand new pseudonymous social profiles, while advertising [krk.finance](https://krk.finance) as backing **X** Project.

This may include, but isn't limited to the followings : 

* Discord Server
* Twitter
* Medium

**subDAO** may be created with it's own set of rules if applicable when required, to give more users to Project Developers and Final Users.


## 4. Scope
The is no limitation to the applicable fields of applications that the Community can bring and support, but our main focus remains **Freedom**, **Privacy**, **Self-Sovereignty**, **Real-Estate**, **Cryptographic Assets**,  **Disruptive Technologies**, **Hackathons**,  and **Educational Content**.

## 5. Limits
**Radical Decentralization** certainly is a form of **Anarchy**, and share its misunderstood underlying principle of **Self-Regulatory Body**, within a **Creative Chaos** where our "**Leaders**" failed to provide sustainable ground for Humanity to thrive.

To ensure cohesive responsibility, no DAO Member shall take part in a Project which may violate the Laws in his Country of Residency if we cannot substituate to it, in which case we may be unable to help.

If, by any mean, one or more DAO members came to vote and agree on a  Project or Proposal violating too much Laws in too many Countries, falling under the "Crime" category as desined by Law in > 66.7% of our DAO Members Country of Residency :

* Such Project shall not be backed by our DAO
* Our DAO cannot accept money from such Project
* Such Project shall be asked to be built elsewhere
* No member shall be harmed for not following such project

This whitepaper being a first version, is subject to changes if requried.

## 6. $KRK Token
‚ö†Ô∏è $KRK Token falls under the categories [memecoin](https://crypto.com/university/what-are-meme-coins/) and [social token](https://phemex.com/academy/what-are-social-tokens) which primarly use will be to whitelist users to fairly mint our NFT Collection, airdrop rewards from ourselves and future partners, and internal stuff that may not surely be profitable, please don't buy or at your own risks ‚ö†Ô∏è
