Inspired from [Chainlink Hackathon Rules](https://docs.chain.link/docs/hackathon-rules-waiver-release-and-code-of-conduct/).

The spirit of The Code is to prohibit activities including but not limited to:

- Comments that others find offensive
- Cheating or taking unfair advantage of other participantsâ€™ work or efforts
- Any activity related to harassing, demeaning, mocking, or intimidating others, especially this behavior as it relates to characteristics such as:
  - Gender
  - Sexual orientation
  - Physical or mental ability
  - Age
  - Socioeconomic status
  - Ethnicity
  - Physical appearance
  - Race
  - Religion
  - Country of origin
- Examples of other prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to:
- Stalking
- Unwanted sexual attention
- Use of sexualized content

Participants asked to stop any behavior deemed as harassment are expected to comply immediately. If a participant fails to comply they will be asked to leave.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates the Code, the hackathon organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the event.

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately to one of the event organizers or by emailing us at legal@krk.finance. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.
